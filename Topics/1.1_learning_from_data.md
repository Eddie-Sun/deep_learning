###### [Progress] Elaborated notes from [Little Book of Deep Learning ](https://fleuret.org/public/lbdl.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3jmeQf1k6Q6Qbp6fDmEtklfqo3XMNrHSoIE_2m8By8cpF2sPZjghuq-Zg)

Machine Learning enable computers to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions. Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning. 

Deep = Mutiple layers in neural networks.

Learning = Find useful patterns or features from this raw data.

### 1. Basic Concept:
- **Signal (x)**: Input data (e.g., an image of a license plate).
- **Predicted Quantity (y)**: The output or result we want to predict (e.g., characters on the license plate).

### 2. High-Dimensional Data in Uncontrolled Environments:
- **Complexity**: In real-world scenarios, the relationship between x (input) and y (output) is often too complex for an analytical formula.
- **Example**: Capturing a high-dimensional signal like an image in a natural setting.

### 3. Training Set (ùíü):
- **Pairs (xn, yn)**: Collection of data pairs where `xn` is an input instance, and `yn` is the corresponding output.
- **Purpose**: Used to teach the model the relationship between inputs and outputs.

### 4. Parametric Model (f):
- **Definition**: A function implemented as computer code. It uses trainable parameters (weights, w) to map inputs to outputs.
- **Trainable Parameters (w)**: Variables in the model that are adjusted during training to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Ideal Outcome (w‚àó)**: The optimal set of parameters where the model's predictions are most accurate.

### 5. Goodness of a Model:
- **Estimated Output (yÀÜ)**: The prediction made by the model, `f(x; w‚àó)`.
- **Accuracy**: The model is considered "good" if its predictions closely match the true outputs in the training set.

### 6. Loss Function (‚Ñí(w)):
- **Purpose**: Measures how well the model is performing. A smaller loss indicates better performance.
- **Training Objective**: Find the value of `w‚àó` that minimizes the loss function.

### 7. Model Definition and Complexity:
- **Sub-modules**: Realistic models often consist of complex combinations of predefined components.
- **Content Focus**: The main focus is defining the function `f`, which can be complex in realistic scenarios.

### 8. Weights and Meta-Parameters:
- **Weights**: Often analogized with synaptic weights in neural networks; these are the parameters optimized during training.
- **Meta-Parameters**: Set based on domain knowledge, best practices, or constraints. They're optimized differently from weights.
